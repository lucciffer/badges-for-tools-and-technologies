# badges-for-tools-and-technologies
This repository will contain badges for most common and widely used tools, technologies, and languages.

To use any of the badges, simply navigate to `Badges.md` and copy the markdown code of the desired badge, and paste it in your markdown file.  
You can also customize the badges according to your taste.  

## Customizing badge text
To change the text of the badge, simply replace the corresponding text in the link with your desired text.  
For example, 
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-black?style=flat-square&logo=Python)  
you can change the text from Python to any other text say 'example' by replacing 'Python' with 'example' in the link that appears after `badge/-`
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-example-black?style=flat-square&logo=Python) 


## Customizing badge colors  
To change the color of the badge, change the color paramter (hex code of the color) that appears next to the badge text in the link.
